Before undertaking repointing work with lime mortar on any site, there are a number of things to consider: what is the overall context of the building? Which material should I use? How should I do the work? 

This lime mortar guidance tool is designed to help you identify the right materials and the appropriate best-practice methods to use. 

It also offers access to where and when to seek advice. 

## Who is this tool for? 

Anyone working with lime, specifying it and wanting to know more, being a building contractor, tradesman, homeowner, young practitioner or architect.
 
This tool was developed in collaboration with the University of Oxford, OxRBL group, and Cliveden Conservation and supported by the EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account.
