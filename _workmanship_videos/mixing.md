This guide includes best-practices for making hydraulic and non-hydraulic lime mortar mixes.

## Making a hot-mixed mortar
Always wear a protective kit. 

* **00:18** Measure all materials. Natural pozzolan can be added to give a hydraulic set to a non-hydraulic mortar. 
* **00:38** Mix dry aggregates and add quicklime.
*	**01:10** Pour some water onto the quicklime: this is called slaking. The exothermic reaction will start and transform calcium oxide into calcium hydroxide. Lumps of quicklime are turning into powder. 
* **01:36** Cover over with sand and start mixing. 
* **01:55** Add water little by little.
* **02:05** Continue mixing/beating the mortar for at least 20 minutes until you reach a stiff mortar that sticks to the trowel. 

## Mixing NHL
* **00:15** Measure the materials.
* **00:35** Dry mix and add water.
* **01:20** Rest the mix for at least 20 minutes so that NHL can absorb moisture.
* **01:32** Remix and add further water.

## Mixing Lime putty
Natural pozzolan can be added in non-hydraulic lime to give a hydraulic set and increase durability.
* **02:37** No water is needed in the mix.
