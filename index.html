  <h1 class="article-header__title">Practical advice for working with lime mortar</h1>
  <p>Lime mortar is a sustainable, long-lasting and historically-authentic material. But before using it for repointing work, there are a number of things to consider.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>What’s the overall context of the building? What type of stone is it constructed from? How exposed is it to the environment?</p></li>
    <li><p>What materials should be used? Which choice of lime and aggregate is appropriate for this building?</p></li>
    <li><p>How should I carry out the work? How can I ensure the repointing is successful?</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This site brings together practical information for working with lime mortar to address these questions.</p>
  <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
  <p>This site is designed for anyone who’s working with or wants to learn more about lime mortar, including building contractors, tradesmen, homeowners, practitioners and architects.</p>
