      <p class="p-large">Lime mortar is a sustainable, long-lasting and historically-authentic material. But before using it for repointing work, there are a number of things to consider:</p>
      <p class="p-large">What type of stone is the building made from? How exposed is it to the environment?</p>
      <p class="p-large">Which choice of lime and aggregate is appropriate for this building?</p>
      <p class="p-large">How can I ensure the repointing is successful?</p>
      <p class="p-large">This website is designed to help you learn about lime, select the right materials and follow best-practice in your repointing work.</p>
