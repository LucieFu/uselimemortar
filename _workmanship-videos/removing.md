Weathered mortar needs to be removed and replaced as the loss of cohesion increases the risk of moisture ingress in the masonry.

* **00:09** Rake weathered mortar out manually with a chisel and if necessary, a hammer.
* **00:24** The depth depends on the repointing mortar to be used. With NHL, it is important to remove to a depth of at least twice the height of the joint.
* **00:46** Dust out debris.
* **00:58** Finish with square-cut joints.
* Throroughly rinse with water before repointing.
