The performance of repointing mortar is dependent on preparation of the substrate, application of materials and aftercare. 

Here are some best-pactice key steps to follow when repointing:

* **00:02** Repointing with non-permeable, highly hydraulic material will trap moisture which will cause damage to the masonry when it evaporates.
* **00:28** The joints must be thoroughly dampened to reduce suction, improve adhesion of the mortar and prevent the mortar from drying too quickly.
* **01:12** Joints need to be thoroughly filled and compacted to avoid voids. Can be done at once with a hot-mixed and in layers for a NHL mortar. 
* **01:27** Joints should be filled slightly proud.
* **01:52** With NHL, regular mist spraying may be needed to maintain damp conditions as the mortar starts to set .
* **02:52** Cover NHL with damp hessian to stop evaporation and help it cure.
