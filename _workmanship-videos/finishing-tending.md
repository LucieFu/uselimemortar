Finishing and tending are essential for the success of the repointing mortar. There are many traditional finishes (recessed/brushed back, flush pointing, penny struck, etc) which can be learned in various training courses.

Here are the steps to follow for recessed pointing:

* **00:11** Once firm, excess mortar can be scraped away with a small trowel.
* **00:30** The use of the churn brush helps to compact the joints, reduce shrinkage and increases the surface area which aids drying.
* **00:50** With non-hydraulic lime in very hot, cold or wet weather, cover with damp hessian.
* **01:20** With NHL, spray daily and cover with damp hessian for at least a week.
