# Types of lime


## Two types of lime 
Lime is produced by burning limestones in a kiln to a temperature of 800°C to 1000°C, depending on the clay content of the limestones.

Pure limestones without clay, produce non-hydraulic lime, also called air lime.

Clay-containing limestones produce hydraulic lime or water lime.

### Non-hydraulic lime / Air lime 
* Air lime sets and hardens using carbon dioxide present in the air (a process called carbonation).
* Air lime gains less strength over time and remains highly permeable.
* Additives, such as ceramic dust or fly ash, can be added to air lime to give it hydraulicity and strength. They are called pozzolan.

### Hydraulic lime / Water lime
* Hydraulic lime also needs moisture in the air to set and therefore can cure under humid environmental conditions - this is what we called the hydraulicity.
* Hydraulic lime gains strength over time which usually decreases its permeability. Some hydraulic lime can become stronger than a weak masonry.

The illustration below shows that, in general, the more hydraulic a binder is, the less permeable it is.

## Forms of lime

There are four main forms of lime easily available to purchase:
* non-hydraulic lime putty
* non-hydraulic quicklime (calcium oxide (CaO)): mixing quicklime with water will generate heat and make a hot-mix mortar
* non-hydraulic lime + pozzolan to give some hydraulicity to the lime
* natural hydraulic lime (NHL) comes as a hydrated lime to different levels of hydraulicity: 2, 3.5 and 5
