## Two types of lime 
Lime is produced by burning limestones in a kiln to a temperature of 800°C to 1000°C, depending on the clay content of the limestones.

Pure limestones without clay, produce non-hydraulic lime, also called air lime.

Limestones with clay produce hydraulic lime or water lime.

### Non-hydraulic lime / Air lime 
* Air lime sets and hardens using carbon dioxide present in the air (a process called carbonation).
* Air lime gains less strength over time than hydraulic lime and remains highly permeable.

### Hydraulic lime / Water lime
* Hydraulic lime needs moisture of the air in addition to carbonation to set (a process  called hydration). 
* Hydraulic lime can cure under humid environmental conditions - this is what we called the hydraulicity.
* Hydraulic lime gains strength over time which usually decreases its permeability. As a result, some hydraulic lime can become stronger than masonry with weak materials such as bricks.

### Additives
* Additives, such as ceramic dust or fly ash, can be added to air lime to give a hydraulic set. Most of them  are called pozzolan.
* There are organic and inorganic pozzolan as well as natural and artificial ones.

## Forms of lime

{% include image-row.html images=page.forms-of-lime %}

There are four main forms of lime easily available to purchase:
* non-hydraulic lime putty
* non-hydraulic quicklime (calcium oxide (CaO)): mixing quicklime with water will generate heat and make a hot-mixed mortar
* non-hydraulic lime + pozzolan to give some hydraulicity to the lime
* natural hydraulic lime (NHL) comes as a hydrated lime to different levels of hydraulicity: 2, 3.5 and 5

Lime is not more expensive than alternatives and minimises the work to do on the masonry in the future as it contributes to its conservation.
